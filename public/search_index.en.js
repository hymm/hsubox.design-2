Normal systems which are what most people are familiar with. They take SystemParam's like Res and Query and are allowed to run in parallel as long as they don't break rust's aliasing rules. And then exclusive systems, which take &amp;mut World in the first paramter and can only be run \"exclusively\" i.e. no other systems can run at the same time.\nThere are a couple big advantages to exclusive systems. One is that all modifications to world happen immediately. The other being when it's hard to specify all your system params up front. i.e. user callbacks. Some disadvantages would be having to run single threaded and that it can be hard to get multiple things out of the world do to mutability rules.\nAdding an Exclusive System to your App\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut app = App::new();\n    app.add_systems(Update, my_exclusive_system);\n}\n\n// An exclusive system is a system that takes `&amp;mut World` as the first parameter.\nfn my_exclusive_system(world: &amp;mut World) {\n    // do something with the world\n} \n\nExclusiveSystemParam's\nBesides &amp;mut World there are 3 other types that are allowed to follow &amp;mut World in the function signature.\n&amp;mut QueryState and &amp;mut SystemState\nfn query_state(\n  world: &amp;mut World, \n  // we can specify the query params like we do with `Query`\n  query: &amp;mut QueryState&lt;(&amp;Component1, &amp;Component2)&gt;) {\n  for (c1, c2) in query.iter(world) {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\nfn system_state(\n  world: &amp;mut World,\n  // we can use any params that work normally with systems\n  state: &amp;mut SystemState&lt;(\n    ResMut&lt;Resource1&gt;,\n    Query&lt;(&amp;mut Component1, With&lt;Component2&gt;)&gt;\n  )&gt;\n) {\n  let (res, query) = state.get_mut(world);\n  // do something with `res` and `query`\n}\n\nQueryState and SystemState are used to get queries and system params from the world respectively. The difference from the normal Query or derive(SystemParam) is that they need to have the World provided to them to get data out of the world. This step is done for you automatically when a normal system runs.\nYou can also just construct these types for use with the world.\n\n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct Component1;\n\n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct Component2;\n\nlet mut world = World::new();\n\nlet query_state: QueryState&lt;(&amp;Component1, &amp;Component2)&gt; = QueryState::new(&amp;mut world);\n\nThe disadvantage here is that QueryState and SystemState often are caching data to make things work or make things faster. There are also types like EventReader that don't work correctly when they aren't cached.\nLocal\nLocal is a system param that works on both normal systems and exclusive systems. It's useful for caching local state in a system. In fact &amp;mut SystemState and &amp;mut QueryState is mostly just sugar for Local&lt;SystemState&gt; and Local&lt;QueryState&gt;.\nModifying the World Directly\nNormal systems aren't allowed to make structural changes to the world directly. Structure changes are things like inserting or removing components or spawning or despawning an entity. These operations require mutable access to the world which is not allowed from normal systems. From those systems these changes are queued through Commands and then applied to the World when a apply_deferred system is run. This makes things like spawning an entity and then acting on that data more complex. But from an exclusive system these changes happen immediately, so it can be easier if you need to do these more complex actions to do them from an exclusive system.\nSpawning and Despawning Entities\nIn an exclusive system we can observe spawns and despawns immediately.\nfn spawn_and_despawn(\n    world: &amp;mut World, \n    query: &amp;mut QueryState&lt;Entity, With&lt;Component1&gt;&gt;\n) {\n    // world has no entities\n    assert_eq!(query.iter(world).len(), 0);\n\n    // we can get the spawned entity immediately\n    world.spawn(Component1);\n    let entity = query.single(world);\n \n    // the entity is despawned immediately\n    world.despawn(entity);\n    assert_eq!(query.iter(world).len(), 0);\n}\n\nEntityMut and EntityRef\nWe can get arbitrary data with an EntityRef or insert or remove arbitrary data on an entity with EntityMut.\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\n\nlet mut world = World::new();\n\n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct Name(String);\n\n#[derive(Component, PartialEq, Debug)]\nstruct Position {\n    x: f32,\n    y: f32,\n}\n\n// world.spawn returns an `EntityMut`\nlet mut entity_mut = world.spawn(Name(\"Brian\".to_string()));\nentity_mut.insert(Position { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 });\nlet entity = entity_mut.id();\n\n// remove the name component and get ownership\nlet mut entity_mut = world.entity_mut(entity);\nlet name = entity_mut.take::&lt;Name&gt;().unwrap();\nassert_eq!(name.0, \"Brian\");\n\n// get some data\nlet position = entity_mut.get::&lt;Position&gt;().unwrap();\nassert_eq!(position, &amp;Position { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 });\n\nYou might want to use a EntityRef instead of EntityMut when you want to get multiple references.\n// entity ref has all the same methods that take &amp;self, but none that take &amp;mut\nlet entity_ref_1 = world.entity(entity1);\nlet entity_ref_2 = world.entity(entity2);\nassert!(entity_ref_1.contains::&lt;Name&gt;() &amp;&amp; entity_ref_2.contains::&lt;Name&gt;());\n\nIf you tried the same with entity_mut you would get a compile error.\n// This will not compile, because rust does not allow 2 mutable references to exist to the world.\nlet entity_mut_1 = world.entity_mut(entity1);\nlet entity_mut_2 = world.entity_mut(entity2);\nassert!(entity_mut_1.contains::&lt;Name&gt;() &amp;&amp; entity_mut_2.contains::&lt;Name&gt;());\n\n// The compile error message:\n// error[E0499]: cannot borrow `world` as mutable more than once at a time\n//   --&gt; src\\lib.rs:203:20\n//    |\n// 13 | let entity_mut_1 = world.entity_mut(entity1);\n//    |                    ------------------------- first mutable borrow occurs here\n// 14 | let entity_mut_2 = world.entity_mut(entity2);\n//    |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ second mutable borrow occurs here\n// 15 | assert!(entity_mut_1.contains::&lt;Name&gt;() &amp;&amp; entity_mut_2.contains::&lt;Name&gt;());\n//    |         ------------------------------- first borrow later used here\n\nThere are also failable versions, get_entity and get_entity_mut, that return an option.\nCheck out the docs for more methods on EntityMut and EntityRef.\nQueries\nlet mut query_state = world.query::&lt;&amp;Name&gt;();\nfor name in query_state.iter(world) {\n    println!(\"{}\", name.0);\n}\n\nlet player_name = world\n    .query_filtered::&lt;&amp;Name, With&lt;Player&gt;&gt;()\n    .single(world);\n\nprintln!(\"{}\", player_name.0);\n\n// use &amp;mut on the component to get a mutable reference and _mut version\\\n// of `single_mut` or `iter_mut`.\nlet mut player_name = world\n    .query_filtered::&lt;&amp;mut Name, With&lt;Player&gt;&gt;()\n    .single_mut(world);\nplayer_name.0 = \"Matilda\".to_string();\n\nprintln!(\"{}\", player_name.0); // prints \"Matilda\"\n\nresources\n\nresource_scope\nresource\nresource_mut\ninit_resource\ninsert_resource\nremove_resource\n\nMiscelaneous\n\nremoved\nsend_event\nsend_event_batch\ninspect_entity\n\nTaking ownership of data\n\nremove_resource\ntake\n\nParamState\nCommon Patterns\nrunning a closure\nRunning Schedules\nRunning systems\n\nNotes to Self: More realistic components and resource.\n\n2 ways to get entity component data on world.

The example\ncode just uses the default plugins and spawns a single camera. \n#![windows_subsystem = \"windows\"]\n\nuse bevy::prelude::{App, Camera2dBundle, Commands, DefaultPlugins};\n\nfn main() {\n    App::new()\n        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n        .add_startup_system(setup_camera)\n        .run();\n}\n\nfn setup_camera(mut commands: Commands) {\n    commands.spawn().insert_bundle(Camera2dBundle::default());\n}\n\nSo with some simple theorizing, we can guess that the problem is related to rendering.\nMost of that logic doesn't run when there isn't a camera. Unfortunately this doesn't\nnarrow the problem much as rendering is a fairly large portion of the code base. We also\nprobably know that this is probably caused by some thing that keeps growing in size or \na something like a circular reference. This is because rust is pretty good at deallocating\nthings automatically when they are no longer used. This theorizing doesn't really narrow things\ndown too much, so we're going to need some more information to find the leak.\nUsing some basic memory monitoring tools, we can see that it's about a 2kb/s sized \nleak. So it seems to be something that is happening during every frame. There are tools \nfor investigating all the allocations and deallocations happening in a program. So hopefully we\ncan use one of those. Unfortunately I'm on Windows, so Valgrind \nwasn't an option. It was something that commonly came up when googling for tools.\nI eventually found leak-detector-allocator\nin crates.io. It seemed pretty promising. leak-detector-allocator replaces the global \nallocator in rust and then tracks the allocations and deallocations in your rust program.\nIt only reports any allocations without a corresponding deallocation. This seemed like \nit would work reasonably well if I could get it to work. \nAfter a bit of weirdness with the program crashing due to the stack getting too big. I\nwas able to cobble together some code that did work. Below is code that combines the code \nfrom the issue with the example code from leak-detector-allocator. It logs the allocated \nmemory for specific frames, which we can then compare to each other. Note that\nusing the allocator makes things run around 10x slower and I'm also using debug mode to get the better\nsymbol names. So hopefully it'll be obvious within the first few hundred frames or so what the memory leak\nis or else I'm going to be waiting around a lot. Given the earlier investigations with just watching the\ntotal memory use, I'm pretty sure this will work.\nuse bevy::{\n    app::AppExit,\n    prelude::{App, Camera2dBundle, Commands, DefaultPlugins, EventWriter, Local},\n};\nuse leak_detect_allocator::LeakTracer;\n\n#[global_allocator]\nstatic LEAK_TRACER: LeakTracer&lt;10&gt; = LeakTracer::new();\n\nfn main() {\n    dbg!(\"start\");\n    LEAK_TRACER.init();\n    let mut app = App::new();\n    app.add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n        .add_startup_system(setup_camera)\n        .add_system(log_leaks);\n    app.run();\n}\n\nfn setup_camera(mut commands: Commands) {\n    commands.spawn(Camera2dBundle::default());\n}\n\nfn log_leaks(mut c: Local&lt;i32&gt;, mut exit: EventWriter&lt;AppExit&gt;) {\n    // count the frames\n    *c += 1;\n    // log to file when we get to certain frame counts\n    if *c == 2 || *c == 60 || *c == 120 || *c == 180 || *c == 360 {\n        let mut out = String::new();\n        let mut count = 0;\n        let mut count_size = 0;\n        LEAK_TRACER.now_leaks(|address: usize, size: usize, stack: &amp;[usize]| {\n            count += 1;\n            count_size += size;\n            out += &amp;format!(\"leak memory address: {:#x}, size: {}\\r\\n\", address, size);\n            for f in stack {\n                // Resolve this instruction pointer to a symbol name\n                out += &amp;format!(\n                    \"\\t{:#x}, {}\\r\\n\",\n                    *f,\n                    LEAK_TRACER.get_symbol_name(*f).unwrap_or(\"\".to_owned())\n                );\n            }\n            true // continue until end\n        });\n        out += &amp;format!(\"\\r\\ntotal address:{}, bytes:{}\\r\\n\", count, count_size);\n        let path = format!(\"foo-{}.txt\", *c);\n        std::fs::write(path, out.as_str().as_bytes()).ok();\n    }\n\n    // exit app when we're done logging.\n    if *c &gt; 360 {\n        exit.send(AppExit);\n    }\n}\n\n// sample output\nleak memory address: 0x1a112603bf0, size: 640\n\t0x7ff773919fcd, backtrace::backtrace::trace_unsynchronized&lt;leak_detect_allocator::impl$0::alloc_accounting::closure_env$0&lt;10&gt; &gt;\n\t0x7ff773919fcd, backtrace::backtrace::trace_unsynchronized&lt;leak_detect_allocator::impl$0::alloc_accounting::closure_env$0&lt;10&gt; &gt;\n\t0x7ff7739116a6, leak_detect_allocator::LeakTracer&lt;10&gt;::alloc_accounting&lt;10&gt;\n\t0x7ff773911a2f, leak_detect_allocator::impl$1::alloc&lt;10&gt;\n\t0x7ff77391822c, ecs_guide::_::__rg_alloc\n\t0x7ff775a2024f, alloc::alloc::Global::alloc_impl\n\t0x7ff775a20b7d, alloc::alloc::impl$1::allocate\n\t0x7ff775a1d148, alloc::raw_vec::finish_grow&lt;alloc::alloc::Global&gt;\n\t0x7ff775998741, alloc::raw_vec::RawVec&lt;bevy_ecs::archetype::Archetype,alloc::alloc::Global&gt;::grow_amortized&lt;bevy_ecs::archetype::Archetype,alloc::alloc::Global&gt;\n\t0x7ff77599c0d9, alloc::raw_vec::RawVec&lt;bevy_ecs::archetype::Archetype,alloc::alloc::Global&gt;::reserve_for_push&lt;bevy_ecs::archetype::Archetype,alloc::alloc::Global&gt;\n    \ntotal address:11169, bytes:5827857\n\nThe output is a text file with a ton of entries like the above. It has an address, the size \nof the allocation, and a simple stack trace. For the above we see that we allocated 640 bytes \nfor a RawVec&lt;Archetype&gt;. At the end of the file is the total number of address and bytes that \nare allocated. To find the leak we will need to compare the output from different frames as bevy\nis a program and uses memory so there will be many allocations that show. // awkward phrasing \nVSCode can show the diffs between two different text files. So we use that functionality and then\nmanually go through the diffs. We're looking for an allocation that is growing in size or a bunch \nof somethings that are never getting deallocated.\n\n// diff of allocationed memory from different frames\nEven just looking at the diffs there ends up being a lot of things that are just\nnormal operation of the program. It's pretty normal for things to be allocated for\na bit, but then get dealllocated later. A lot of these are happening every frame\nand it's fairly easy to ignore most of these. We can identify these since they are\nthe same size and even line up in the diff frame to frame. This assumption would \nhave been harder to make if the scene was more dynamic.\nScanning through the diffs that aren't so obvious, I end up seeing this suspicious entry.\n\n// RawVec grows from 1024 to 4096 from frame 120 to 360\nThe first thing to notice that the allocation on the right is fairly large compared \nto others at 4096 bytes. And we can also see a similar deallocation on the left that is\nof the same RawVec&lt;Entity&gt; type that is only 1024 bytes.\nSo it seems a RawVec&lt;Entity&gt; is growing \nacross multiple frames. This is a probably actually a Vec&lt;Entity&gt; \nas RawVec is the underlying storage for a Vec. One thing to note about a vec is \ntypically reallocated by doubling it's capacity, so we don't always see it grow \nbetween frames. In this case it takes 240 frames to go to 4x the capacity. This pattern\nof growth also seemed to be happening when watching the total memory used value in something\nlike the windows task manager. As the memory leak grew larger the time it would take for\nthe amount of memory commited to change would take longer and longer. So this seems like a\nlikely suspect.\nNow we just need to figure out which Vec&lt;Entity&gt; is growing. Doing a text search shows some\ncandidates. \n\n// Small clip of VSCode search for Vec\nMost of the things found are related to rendering. These are things like \ncaching the VisibleEntities, Bones, etc. Checking them by running a dbg!(Vec::capacity) \nshows that most of these are zero. This is unsurprising since the scene is empty, but\nstill worth ruling out.\nOh, but what's this...a Vec is used to store which entities have removed a component\nthe previous frame. It normally gets reset by calling World::clear_trackers in the main \nschedule, so is probably not leaking there. But besides the main world there\nis a separate render world. The render world exists to completely separate the data\nneeded for simulation vs the data needed for rendering, so that the two schedules can\nrun in parallel. It's possible that clear_trackers is not being called on the render\nworld. Checking RemovedComponents's capacity on the render world quickly confirms that this \nis the problem. And from a quick search it is confirmed that clear_trackers is only being\ncalled on the main world. Horay! We've found at least one memory leak.\nAn easy fix is to just call clear_trackers in the render world's schedule. But rendering\nis using an abstraction called SubApp's and users are able to add their own sub apps. So\nit'd be best to fix this in a way that works both for all aub apps. So instead we run it in\nApp::update so it can't be forgotten to be called as long as we're using bevy_app. We \nalso move the call for the main world into this function for consistency's sake.\npub fn update(&amp;mut self) {\n    self.schedule.run(&amp;mut self.world);\n\n    for sub_app in self.sub_apps.values_mut() {\n        (sub_app.runner)(&amp;mut self.world, &amp;mut sub_app.app);\n        sub_app.app.world.clear_trackers();\n    }\n\n    self.world.clear_trackers();\n}\n\nRunning the allocation tracer with this fix for 10000 frames confirms that memory use is \nno longer growing in the example. So it's confirmed this at least fixes the memmory leaks\nin the simple example.\nI'm not sure how generally useful this technique will be. The scene was fairly static, so\nthe noisiness of the allocations wasn't too bad. But with a more dynamic scene I imagine\nthere would be many more allocations to sort through and not all of them will line up\nas neatly. But hopefully this can still work to some degree.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/bevy-mem-leak/","title":"Tracking Down a Memory Leak in Bevy"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/looking-back-at-stageless/":{"body":"Looking Back at Stageless\nBevy's 3rd birthday happened recently, so I'll take this as an opportunity to reflect. In the past year, I've had some significant contributions to Bevy including finishing pipelined rendering, but for this post I'd like to focus on the year-and-a-half journey of the Stageless scheduling rewrite. Much of the heavy lifting for it was done by @alice-i-cecile(RFC) and @maniwani(Implementation), but I'd like to think I contributed significantly by providing ideas, reviewing things, and fixing bugs in the final implementation. From gathering ideas to the implementation PR and numerous follow-up PRs, it was quite the project. This post is mostly about thinking about what went right and what went wrong in the process.\nIntro\nOfficially known as \"Scheduling V3\", the stageless work was a rewrite of system scheduling that aimed to solve a bunch of problems that had come to be obvious with numerous issues and help threads on Discord. The main issues being:\n\nRunCriteria were hard to compose due to them having 4 states. This prevented using simple boolean logic on them when trying to combine them and potentially forcing users to deal with all 16 combinations of state.\nState used looping criteria which could lead to deadlocks if the state was repeatedly changed and could have other surprising behavior related to the looping.\nApplying the command buffers to the world required creating a new stage, but stages were hard barriers between systems, so would require moving the systems to the new stage.\n\nStages were the container for systems and these three problems were intertwined with how stages behaved. Thus \"removing\" stages and making Bevy \"stageless\" was how the work was referred to. Rather than completely removing stages, what happened was a reframing and extending of the existing APIs. But the term stuck around. Through many discussions on Discord and GitHub, the major fixes for these problems that we landed on were to:\n\nRemove looping run criteria and just make run criteria return a simple bool\nReplace looping run criteria with looping inside an exclusive system instead. No engine changes was necessary to enable this. But States and FixedTimeSteps needed to be ported to use this method.\nAllow ordering exclusive systems with normal systems, which would allow manually adding a sync point for commands to be applied anywhere. Before, exclusive sytems could only be scheduled at the beginning or end of a stage.\n\nTimeline\nWhat follows is a rough timeline of the year-and-a-half journey to bring Stageless to fruition.\nPre-RFC Period\n\nSept 9, 2021 ECS Mad Science Lab, stageless-ish R&amp;D started by @Ratysz and @alice-i-cecile. This discussion and #ecs-dev on Discord are the central places where the brainstorming happens before the RFC is created. Alice notably created this graph about the complexity of how the problems are tied together.\nOct 7, 2021 Greedy Stageless RFC. This is my public entrance into working on Stageless. The RFC has the concept of ordering exclusive systems and simplifying run criteria to a bool. But has automatic sync points instead of manual and weird looping criteria as an analog to run criteria. I don't think any of these ideas were particularly novel as they're mentioned in other issues. My motivation in writing it was to bring together these ideas and make it clear that the features were possible to support in the system executor.\nOct 12, 2021 Maniwani publishes Hierarchical Stage Labels. This was focused on addressing points 1 and 2 above, but doesn't address 3. It tried to make more ergonomic states and tries to elevate states as a central concept.\nDiscussions continue on Discord and GitHub between Alice, Maniwani, Ratysz, and myself about how to solve the problems. Eventually using looping in exclusive systems is brought up on Discord. This wasn't a fully original idea as Alice had been recommending this to users for complex control flow for a while. But realizing we could use this for fixed timesteps and states was.\n\nRFC Period\n\nJan 14, 2022 Stageless RFC. Moving looping to inside exclusive systems was the last major piece and Alice proceeded to write the first draft of the Stageless RFC.\nMar 20, 2022 iyes_loopless is published with some of the ideas from the stageless RFC. There are some limitations due to being an external plugin, but this helps prove out some of the ideas in Stageless and brought some much needed API improvements to users.\nApr 1, 2022 maniwani publishes the Scheduling v3 PR Draft. At this time the RFC had yet to be merged. However, creating this draft helped clarify and solidify the concepts that the RFC was proposing.\nSept 19, 2022 Stageless RFC is merged. There are 23 reviewers on the PR and 620 comments. \n\nPost RFC Merged\n\nNov 13, 2022 Schedule V3 PR is opened by maniwani. This is a cleanup of the original draft PR with things implemented in a different module from the original scheduling code and not integrated into the rest of the engine yet.\nJan 16, 2023 Schedule V3 PR is merged with 11 reviewers and 332 comments.\nFeb 1, 2023 Base Sets by cart is merged. This tries to fix default sets, but unfortunately lost in the discussion is that it doesn't fix the original issue.\nFeb 6, 2023 Engine is migrated to schedule v3 by Alice and others is merged. This gets rid of the old scheduling code and migrates the rest of the engine.\nMar 6, 2023 Bevy 0.10 is released with Schedule V3. In the month between the previous and the release, there was a lot of reviewing and fixing of bugs due to the new code.\nMar 13, 2023 Schedule First and Removing Base Sets by cart. Base sets ended up being a confusing concept for users to learn. This pr removes base sets and makes which schedule a system belongs to an explicit rather than implicit API. This was an option considered during the discussions that led to base sets, but base sets were chosen due to being a more succinct API.\n\nNote that this was not a continuous process. In some of the major gaps between dates no work was being done on Stageless. This is just how open source work goes sometimes.\nPost Mortem on the RFC process\nWhat Went Right\n\nWe were able to pare down all the ideas from the earlier discussion down to an MVP. Some things got cut like auto sync points, atomic system sets, and if needed ordering constraints.\nSeeing these things on paper let us understand how all the pieces would fit together. And gave us confidence that the fix was the right fix.\n\nWhat Went Wrong\n\nThe GitHub interface for reviewing PRs did not work well. \n\nIt was easy for comments to get lost and buried as the text was changed. \nLine-by-line editing encouraged nitpicking on phrasing when the larger concepts had not been nailed down yet.\n\n\nThe final RFC was probably too big. Once the big concepts had been nailed down, it probably should have been broken up. The size of the RFC made it hard to review and hard to revise. Personally each review took 4-8 hours and I did multiple full reviews of the RFC and many partial reviews too. Smaller RFCs would have given better focus to each feature, \"Run Conditions\", \"States and Fixed Timesteps\", and \"Ordering Exclusive Systems\" and it would have been easier to carve out time to review them. \n\nHow do RFCs fit into current Bevy?\nI think that having seen the work that went into the Stageless RFC, people are now reluctant to open their own RFCs. They might think it'll be easier to just open a PR and hash things out there. In a lot of cases they're probably right, but I suspect that there are a handfull of current PRs that would have been better served going through the RFC process as they get hung up on their more controversial aspects until the author gets too busy to continue or loses interest. I personally avoid reviewing some PRs because I don't understand the problem space well enough to weigh-in on the controversial aspects of those PRs.\nStageless itself should probably have had a more formal Pre-RFC period where what features needed to be included and which features should be cut was decided. A lot of the early reviews of Stageless focused too much on the details and we ended up with a decent amount of churn on the prose for features that were eventually cut. \nCart has been doing something like Pre-RFC's with his recent rewrites like with assets and scenes. However, these never get promoted to full RFCs. Cart gets away with this because of his BDFL status and his PRs always get priority. This isn't a problem, but it ends up devalueing RFCs more than it should for the average contributor. If the more controversial details have already been hashed out in an RFC. Reviewers can then focus on implementation details and code quality, which more reviewers feel comfortable with. This is all assuming that our experts who review RFCs are able to review RFCs faster than PRs. I'm assuming this is true, but it might be a bad assumption.\nOverall, we need more features to go through the RFC process and see if we can iron out the flaws that currently exist and give a better path for controversial changes to be implemented. Especially now that we have SME's that can merge RFCs. Then we can better understand how RFCs fit into the Bevy contribution picture.\nPost Mortem on the Implementation\nWhat Went Right\n\nFrom a user perspective the scheduling rewrite is very successful. After a few follow-up PRs, I've only really seen good things said about the new APIs.\nMost of what was changed was a reframing and extending the capabilities of what already existed. Doing this led to a simpler mental model needed around scheduling and a mostly smooth trasition for existing users.\n\nWhat Went Wrong\n\nCalling the whole thing \"Stageless\". It gave too much focus to actually removing stages completely, but what we ended up with looked a lot like stages at a macro level. We might have ended up at the macro structure quicker if the name was different.\nWe should have broken up the initial PR. Alice and I had a plan for breaking things up but got pushback. I should have fought a lot harder than I did to actually split things up. Having such a large PR led to a lot of bugs and contributed to Alice and I burning out trying to get things ready for 0.10.\n\nNew Rule: Always encourage breaking up large PRs\nMy new personal rule for my own bevy work and reviewing other PRs is to \"always encourage breaking up large PRs\". The most limiting factor with Bevy velocity is reviewer time. The larger the PR the larger contiguous block of time a reviewer has to set aside. Large PRs do not respect the limited time that our reviewers have. \nSometimes breaking things up might not be possible, but I suspect the amount of times that happens is smaller than we think. Ideally we're able to break large work into multiple refactors that keeps the code working. This can be more work for the author, but I think it'll lead to better code and faster velocity. If this isn't an option, we can have the original code and the rewrite to living in the repository at the same time. This is not ideal as fixes may need to be applied to both sets of code. But this sometimes will be the least worst solution if we need multiple PRs to reach feature parity with an existing solution.\nFuture Scheduling Stuff I may work on\n\nAuto Sync Points I'm currently trying to pick this work back up. Users are currently encouraged to write (my_command_system, apply_deffered, needs_to_observe_first_systems_commands).chain(), when there's a problem with a system not seeing another system's commands. The problem with this is that it could lead to an overly linear schedule with too many apply_deferred systems. The scheduler can be made to insert sync points automatically when there's a before/after relation between two systems with commands.\nScheduling still isn't as easy or understandable as writing imperative code. This is partially just a consequence of having multithreaded scheduling, but I'd like to experiment and see if there's a way of making it easier to understand. It might be possible with something like allowing writing the schedule using async/await.\nData privacy. A lot of my thinking in the initial period of thinking about stageless was around dirty state and how to prevent the wrong systems from seeing that dirty state. Stageless didn't add anything to help solve these problems. I'd like to continue my thinking around it and see if there's a way to solve the problem in ECS. \n\nFinal Thoughts\nI'm really proud to have worked on Stageless. It really feels like it brought a lot of value to Bevy users. For myself, I learned a lot about Bevy and got much better at writing and understanding Rust. I look forward to continuing to contribute to Bevy and participate in this community in the future.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/looking-back-at-stageless/","title":"Looking Back at Stageless"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/about/":{"body":13,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/bevy-guide-exclusive-systems/":{"body":593,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/bevy-mem-leak/":{"body":811,"title":5},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/looking-back-at-stageless/":{"body":1258,"title":3}},"length":6},"lang":"English"};
